module for installing openstack testing/development environment

this module currently only works on Ubuntu Precise.

It should likely add support for running on Mac reasonably soon!

to install, simply run the command:

    > export FACTER_github_user_login=XXXX;export FACTER_github_user_password=XXXXXXX;bash -c "$(curl -fsS https://raw.github.com/bodepd/puppet-openstack_test/master/install.sh)"

(of coarse, you should replace XXX with your github username and password if you intend to use operations that write to
github.

WARNING - this script will uninstall any apt installs of puppet and reinstall it as a gem
### Installing a Jenkins server
