module for installing openstack testing/development environment

this module currently only works on Ubuntu Precise.

It should likely add support for running on Mac reasonably soon!

to install, simply run the command:

    > export FACTER_github_user_login=XXXX;export FACTER_github_user_password=XXXXXXX;bash -c "$(curl -fsS https://raw.github.com/bodepd/puppet-openstack_test/master/install.sh)"
